## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern

All pages follow a consistent structure:

```javascript
import Protected from '../components/Protected';
import { db } from '../lib/firebase';
import { collection, getDocs, query, ... } from 'firebase/firestore';

export default function PageName() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    loadData();
  }, []);

  const loadData = async () => {
    // Firebase queries
  };

  return (
    <Protected>
      {/* Header with icon badge */}
      {/* Gradient stat cards */}
      {/* Data list/table */}
      {/* Actions (refresh, add, edit, delete) */}
    </Protected>
  );
}
```

**Key Components:**
- `Protected` wrapper for auth
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Loading states & spinners
- Gradient stat cards for metrics
- Responsive grid layouts
- Modal forms for add/edit
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
